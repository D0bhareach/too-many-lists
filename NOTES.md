# About
While reading "Learning Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists" I spotted that material is given in rather
consice and short form, at least for me. I would really like to have some topic expanded more detailed.
I for any time have no intention to push anything to original repo. I have no fallacy about my level of 
'expertise' on the topic.    
This is actually third time I tried to read the Book. First I have made in mid summer 2022. I started to cry
after second chapter. Since my level of masohism (inhereted from my mother) is quite high. I took second 
attempt at the end of Oktorber 2022. This time I went to chaprer about unsafe and mira, there I got properly
lost and call it a day. Today 18.03.2023. Eager to see how far I will make it this time.   
# Structure of the Project
I will port old code from my local project and place it in dir `code`. I intentially wrote code as I
read the Book. It's better to try by youself. Code which resides in `lists` dir I will use as read-only.
As to book I will keep all originl text as it is. But will add remarks, notations, folding paragraph and
probably even new chapters.
